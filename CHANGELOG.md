# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Discord `/pi model` autocomplete now reads models from the configured pi binary and honors pi's configured `enabledModels` scope.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Remove stale hardcoded README current-version text so npm/GitHub documentation does not show an outdated release number.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Discord attachments are now passed to `pi` by local file path instead of being injected with `@file`. This keeps binary and structured files such as DOCX, XLSX, PDFs, and images out of the model context while still letting the agent inspect or convert them with tools.
- Downloaded attachment media is retained for a configurable period so path-based agent workflows can continue after the initial message. New config: `MEDIA_RETENTION_HOURS` (default: `168`, one week).

### Fixed

- Empty stdout from `pi` no longer becomes an unhelpful `(empty response)` Discord reply. piscord now reports the recorded agent/session error when available, including context-window errors such as `context_length_exceeded`.
- Prevent large or binary attachments from flooding the model context and causing repeated empty responses in the affected channel session.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fix false `Required peer dependency @earendil-works/pi-ai is not installed` startup error when resolving ESM-only pi packages — thanks @kojira (#10), @hritique (#8)
- Fix cross-platform test failures: config path assertions now use platform-aware defaults instead of hardcoded Linux/XDG paths — thanks @hritique (#9)

## [1.5.2] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- Refresh README presentation for npm/GitHub with banner, badges, and updated project summary

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Startup check for legacy `@mariozechner/pi-ai` — users on the old package now get a clear upgrade message instead of a module-not-found crash

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- macOS launchd support for `piscord daemon` commands — thanks @that-yolanda (#6)
- Windows compatibility for pi subprocess spawning (dynamic .cmd shim resolution)
- Windows `SIGBREAK` signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Cross-platform executable lookup (`where` on Windows, `which` on Linux/macOS)

### Changed

- Migrate pi dependencies from `@mariozechner/*` to `@earendil-works/*` scope (pi v0.74.0+)
- Platform-aware default paths: XDG on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows
- Build script now works cross-platform (replaced `rm -rf` with Node.js `fs.rmSync`)
- Help text uses platform-neutral wording for daemon commands

### Fixed

- `piscord status` no longer crashes on macOS/Windows (removed unconditional systemctl dependency)
- `which` command replaced with cross-platform executable lookup in setup and status

## [1.4.3] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- Restore startup compatibility with @mariozechner/pi-ai 0.72.x thinking level APIs
- Keep legacy @mariozechner/pi-ai compatibility by falling back to the older `supportsXhigh` helper when available

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- Align default runtime XDG data directory with setup and docs to use `~/.local/share/piscord-gateway`

### Fixed
